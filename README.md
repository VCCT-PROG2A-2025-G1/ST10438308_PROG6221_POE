👋Hey there!
Welcome to the Cybersecurity Awareness Bot. I’m here to help you stay safe online.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your name?
Funi
Welcome, Funi!
💻🔒Let's talk cybersecurity. How can I assist?

💬You can ask me things like:
- How are you?
- What can I ask you?
- How do you work?
- What is phishing?
- What is a strong password?
- Tell me about yourself, your age, whether you're a student, professor or engineer and the 2 topics
 you're interested in!
 OR (Type 'exit' to quit.)

Funi: How are you?
CyberBot: I'm great, Funi! Always ready to fight cyber threats.

Funi: I am a 21 year old student who is interested in malware and phishing
CyberBot: Thanks for sharing about yourself, Funi! I noted your age as 21, role as student, and interests in malware, phishing.


Funi: what is malware
CyberBot: Malware is software designed to damage your system. Use antivirus and be cautious of suspicious files.

Funi: explain more
CyberBot: Keep your operating system and antivirus software updated regularly.

Funi: what are some good phishing tips
CyberBot: Legitimate organizations will rarely ask for sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers via email.

Funi: can you give me more details
CyberBot: Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click!

Funi: thank you
CyberBot: You're welcome! 😊 Is there anything else you'd like to know?

Funi: exit
CyberBot:  Goodbye, Funi! Stay safe online.
